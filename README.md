## Deployment

The easiest way to get started with Github-Graphs is to fork this repository
and follow the instructions below.

#### Create a new OAuth app

The objective of creating an app under your github account is to access an
endpoint through the GitHub API and obtain credentials to set your environment
file. For more information on how to create a new OAuth app, consult the corresponding
Github developer documentation [here](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).

#### Create a .env file

After forking this repository, run the command `cd server/`. Inside that folder,
setup your environment credentials by creating a `.env file` with the code below filled in.

```
CLIENT_ID = <your_client_ID_from_oauth_app>
CLIENT_SECRET = <your_generated_personal_access_from_oauth_app>
SESSION_SECRET = <any_string_you_want>
PORT = <any_number>
```

The creation of your OAuth app and the .env file are required steps,
irrespective of your desired deployment environment. For specific directions,
continue by following the steps specified below.

### Deployment on the local machine

#### Install dependencies

Dependencies are installed using `npm`. Therefore, please install the package manager
before proceeding. If you already have `npm` installed, run the command below inside
`server/` in order to install the dependencies in the package directory.

```bash
npm install
```

#### Explore GitHub-Graphs

Inside `server/`, run the following command to start the program, and in your
browser, check `localhost:8000` to visualize your Github network.

```bash
node server.js
```

### Deployment in a Docker container

Github-graphs can also be deployed inside a docker container and displayed in
your browser through port mapping. To get started run the following commands
inside your forked repository.

The easiest way to deploy in a docker container is through the use of our proposed
`docker-compose.yml` file. If you choose this methodology, make sure the port numbers
in your `.env` file matches the docker-compose file. Note that this approach will work
only on systems which have Docker and Docker-compose both installed.
Considering the example provided in our provided docker-compose,
the port number of the .env file should be `PORT= 8000`. Therefore, you could
visualize the Github-Graphs page at `localhost:8080` after running:

```
    docker-compose up -d --build
```

In order to clean the environment, you can run the following command.

```
    docker-compose down --rmi all

```

Besides the use of docker-compose, deployment with just docker is possible with the following commands:\

```
    docker build -t <choose_name_for_image> .
    docker run -d --name <choose_name_for_container> -p <local_port_num>:<port_num_from_env_file> <name_of_image>
```

For instance, assume I name my image `graph-app`, my container `github-graphs`,
and set the port number in my .env file to `8000`, I can decide to listen on my localhost at port `8080`.
Therefore, my commands are:

```
    docker build -t graph-app .
    docker run -d --name github-graphs -p 8080:8000 graph-app
```

If you are willing to read the debugging statement on the CLI, do not add `-d` to the `docker run` statement.

At this step, you can now visualize Github graphs at `localhost:<local_port_num>`.
